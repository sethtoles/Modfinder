Modfinder
=========

A tool for finding compatible housemates. This was a collaboration with [Zeke Nierenberg](http://github.com/zekenie)

**THIS IS NOT THE FULL SOURCE**

The rest is [here](http://zekenie.github.io/div-iii/modfinder-source/index.html)

We originally had the full project up as a repo, but found we had accidentally pushed commits containing passwords. Included here is the matching algorith I wrote (server.js) based on Zeke's pseudocode (pseudo.txt). This algorithm ran seperately from the rest of the app.
